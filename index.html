        I gaze at the beautiful sunset,
        Portrayed by an Artist Divine,
        In colors of roseate splendor,
        In which mellow glories do shine.

        Was ever a scene so majestic
        Wrought daily for mortals below?
        Methinks that the angels of heaven
        Are charmed with its radiant glow.

        Now misty, gray clouds are approaching;
        Will they hinder this marvelous scene?
        Ah, no! they transform to the grandeur
        Of the sunset, so calm and serene.

        The mountains so lofty and somber,
        And hitherto bleak as the snow,
        Now bathed in this far-reaching splendor,
        Become with the sunset aglow.

        Then each with its rare beauty tinted,
        Reflects on the valley forlorn,
        The soft, mellow halo of sunset,
        More fair than the glow of the moon.

        Be each of our lives as the sunset,
        Adorned by the great Artist’s hand,
        Reflecting the light in the darkness
        As He in his wisdom has planned,

        Till like the gray clouds and bleak mountains,
        And the vale when the day has withdrawn,
        Each life may be lighted with beauties —
        As these, and keep passing them on.

        And as we are clothed like the sunset,
        With beauty the world to adorn,
        God grant that life’s eve be more brilliant.
        With glory, by far, than its morn.
